Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:
round robin without pre-emption


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 
(1277 + 1278 + 1279 + 1280)/4 = 1278.5 ms

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
(320 + 640 + 960 + 1280)/4 = 800 ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
(0 + 1 + 2 + 3)/4 = 1.5 ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
(0 + 320 + 640 + 960)/4 = 480 ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?
both

Exercise 5:
The first interrupt is during process 4 since the process is stopped before it prints '4', resulting in "...1234 123 1234..."

(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)


Anything else you'd like us to know:
This lab was pretty okay


Extra credit exercises:
Exercise 7:
Implemented a lottery scheduling system by giving processes a p_tickets variable and assigning each one an arbitrary number of tickets, then using a Fibonacci LFSR to pick a random ticket and run the corresponding process.

Exercise 8:
Implemented a system call to print characters (sys_print). Exercise 6 used athe atomic_swap function defined in x86sync.h.
